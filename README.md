### Concept 

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.

Linear functions provide the basis for many learning algorithms. Linear regression is the problem of fitting a linear function to a set of input-output pairs given a set of training examples, in which the input and output features are numeric. 

General equation of line: y = ax + b

Here we will find the values of a & b using given values(Training Cases) of x & y

### Anaconda Navigator & Spyder

Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands.

Spyder is a powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features. Additionally, Spyder is a numerical computing environment thanks to the support of IPython and popular Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, or matplotlib.

### Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

    A powerful N-dimensional array object
    Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
    Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.
